    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> August 10, 2025</p>
    <p>Thank you for choosing <strong>CTADE</strong> ("we", "us" or "our"). Your privacy matters to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and the choices you have regarding your information when you use the CTADE mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>

    <p>When you use the App, we may automatically collect technical and usage information, including device identifiers, operating system version, mobile network information, IP address, crash reports, and analytics data about how you interact with the App.</p>

    <h3>1.3 Cookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
    <p>We and our service providers may use cookies, local storage, and similar technologies to collect information to improve the Appâ€™s performance and your experience. Mobile platforms may provide equivalent identifiers (e.g., advertising identifiers).</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide, maintain, and improve the App and its features;</li>
      <li>To process transactions and send related information, including purchase confirmations and invoices;</li>
      <li>To respond to your requests, questions, or support inquiries;</li>
      <li>To send administrative messages, security alerts, and other information related to the App;</li>
      <li>For analytics, research, and to help us understand and improve user experience;</li>
      <li>To comply with applicable laws and to protect our rights and safety and those of others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We will not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> We may share data with vendors and third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf (e.g., hosting, analytics, payment processing) under contractual confidentiality obligations.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> If required by law, legal process, or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, we may disclose information.</li>
      <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, user information may be transferred as part of that transaction (with notice to users when required).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may integrate or communicate with third-party services and SDKs (e.g., analytics, advertising, payment processors). These third parties may collect information directly from your device and have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to read third-party privacy notices to understand their practices.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the App and services, to fulfill legal or contractual obligations, and to resolve disputes. When data is no longer needed, we will delete or anonymize it unless retention is required by law.</p>

    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your personal data, including the right to access, correct, delete, or export your data. To exercise these rights, please contact us using the contact information below. We may need to verify your identity before processing requests.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
